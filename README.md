**Rebalanced Loot** is a datapack and mod that alters the loot you get from chests!

## Description

Rebalanced Loot changes the loot you obtain from chests to do two things:

1. Immerse the player more with the world. It makes way more sense to find items like raw ores and used pickaxes in Abandoned Mineshafts then melon seeds, for example. Changes like this are made to most chest loot tables with this pack.

2. Make there an incentive to go to rarer structures for better loot. You rarely ever go to Woodland Mansions because there's no incentive to; the loot is barely better than dungeon loot, and the only unique item truly unique to it is the Vex armor trim. Hopefully with the great loot boost to this structure and other rare structures, players are more incentivized to hunt out these structures.

This pack adds no new blocks or items, and thus is entirely server-side.
